# Detailed Step-by-Step Plan for End-to-End Automation System
This plan outlines the process to build an automated system that extracts, cleans, and compresses the schema of a Microsoft SQL Server database. The system is designed to handle hundreds of tables while ensuring that the context of the data sent to an LLM is within token limits. The plan includes token counting via `tiktoken` and, if necessary, mechanisms to break data into subparts while preserving context.

---

## 1. Environment Setup

1. **Install Required Packages**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
   - Install necessary libraries:
     - `pyodbc` for connecting to Microsoft SQL Server.
     - `tiktoken` for token counting.
     - `openai` (or your chosen LLM API client) for interacting with the LLM.
     - Additional libraries: `sqlalchemy` (optional), `pandas`, and `networkx` (for graph-based analysis).
   
   **Example:**
   ```bash
   pip install pyodbc tiktoken openai sqlalchemy pandas networkx
   ```

2. **Configure Database Connection**
   - Create a configuration file (e.g., `config.json` or use environment variables) to store credentials:
     - Host, port, username, password, database name.
   - Ensure that the connection is set to read-only mode where possible to protect production data.

---

## 2. Database Connection & Schema Introspection

1. **Establish the Connection**
   - Use `pyodbc` to connect to the SQL Server.
   - Alternatively, use SQLAlchemy with a proper connection string for abstraction.
   
2. **Retrieve List of Tables**
   - Execute a query against system catalog views (e.g., `sys.tables`) to list all user tables.
   
3. **Extract Detailed Metadata for Each Table**
   - For every table, extract:
     - **Columns & Data Types:** Query `sys.columns`.
     - **Primary Keys:** Query `sys.key_constraints` and related indexes.
     - **Foreign Keys:** Query `sys.foreign_keys` and join with `sys.objects`.
     - **Indexes and Constraints:** Extract as needed.
   - **Store Metadata:** Organize the extracted metadata in a Python dictionary or DataFrame.

---

## 3. Cleaning and Standardizing Metadata

1. **Standardize Naming Conventions**
   - Clean table and column names (e.g., remove underscores, standardize case formatting).
   
2. **Filter Out Unnecessary Data**
   - Exclude system tables, temporary tables, or tables marked as deprecated.
   
3. **Validate Relationships**
   - Ensure that foreign key references point to valid tables and that all key constraints are consistent.
   
4. **Log Inconsistencies**
   - Maintain a log file for any anomalies detected during cleaning for later manual review.

---

## 4. Token Counting and Data Chunking Setup

1. **Integrate `tiktoken`**
   - Import and initialize `tiktoken` to count tokens for each prompt you plan to send to the LLM.
   
2. **Set Token Limits**
   - Define a maximum of **3000 tokens** per LLM prompt.
   - Also, monitor for larger cumulative sizes (e.g., 30,000 tokens). If exceeded:
     - **Break Input into Subparts:** Split the table's metadata accordingly.
     - **Maintain Context:**
       - When sending a subsequent subpart, prepend a brief summary of the previous subpart. This summary can either be auto-generated or produced by the LLM.

3. **Develop a Utility Function for Token Management**
   - Create a function that accepts text inputs, counts tokens, and determines whether they need to be chunked.
   - Example pseudocode:
     ```python
     import tiktoken

     def count_tokens(text, encoding_name="gpt-4"):
         encoding = tiktoken.get_encoding(encoding_name)
         return len(encoding.encode(text))

     def chunk_text(text, max_tokens=3000):
         # Implement logic to split 'text' into chunks such that each chunk is within max_tokens
         # Yield each chunk and, for chunks after the first, include a brief summary of the previous chunk.
         ...
     ```

---

## 5. Semantic Enhancement and Summarization via LLM

1. **Construct Prompts for Each Table**
   - For each table (or table chunk if the token limit is exceeded), prepare a prompt including:
     - The table name.
     - Its cleaned metadata in JSON or structured formatting.
   
2. **Token Counting Before Sending to LLM**
   - Use the token counting utility to ensure that each prompt is below the 3000-token limit.
   - If a table's metadata exceeds this limit, use the chunking mechanism:
     - Split the data.
     - For each chunk after the first, prepend a short summary of the previous chunk(s) to maintain context.
   
3. **Call the LLM for Summarization**
   - Use the `openai.ChatCompletion.create()` method (or similar) with your prompt to generate a descriptive summary.
   - Handle errors and implement retries if necessary.
   
4. **Aggregate Summaries**
   - Collect the LLM's output summaries for each table.
   - Store them in a consolidated data structure (e.g., dictionary mapping table names to summaries).

---

## 6. Schema Compression & Meta-Schema Generation

1. **Compile Compressed Schemas**
   - For each table, include:
     - Table Name.
     - LLM-generated summary.
     - Key columns such as primary keys and essential foreign keys.
     - Critical relationships captured from the metadata.
   
2. **Graph-Based Relationship Analysis (Optional)**
   - Use `networkx` to model the schema as a graph (tables as nodes, foreign keys as edges).
   - Identify clusters and highly connected subgraphs.
   - Optionally, generate aggregated summaries for these clusters.
   
3. **Format the Final Meta-Schema**
   - Organize the compressed schema into a final output format (e.g., JSON or markdown).
   - Ensure that each entry is concise and optimized for efficient retrieval during the text-to-SQL generation phase.

---

## 7. Final Output and Persistence

1. **Save the Optimized Schema**
   - Write the final meta-schema to a file (e.g., `optimized_schema.json` or `optimized_schema.md`).
   
2. **Include Metadata**
   - Add additional metadata (e.g., processing time, database connection details, version, and logs).
   
3. **Validation**
   - Verify that the output file is well-formatted and that all tables have been processed.

---

## 8. Testing & Iteration

1. **Unit and Integration Tests**
   - Write tests for:
     - Database connection.
     - Metadata extraction and cleaning.
     - Token counting and chunking mechanisms.
     - LLM interaction and response parsing.
   
2. **Benchmarking the Token Chunks**
   - Run sample tables through the token counting utility to ensure proper chunking at the 3000-token limit.
   
3. **Iterative Improvements**
   - Based on test results and manual feedback, refine cleaning rules, chunking mechanisms, and summarization prompts.
   - Monitor performance aspects like processing speed and LLM response quality.

---

## 9. Future Integration Steps

1. **Integration with Text-to-SQL Component**
   - Prepare the meta-schema to be consumable by the query-generation pipeline.
   - Ensure that the retrieval mechanisms are in place to supply the relevant schema parts based on the user query.
   
2. **Feedback Loop Implementation**
   - Set up logging to capture user interactions and model outputs.
   - Use human feedback to further refine the schema extraction and summarization pipeline.

---

## Final Considerations

- **Context Management:**  
  - Always ensure that all prompts sent to the LLM have enough context by including summaries as needed.
  
- **Scalability:**  
  - Consider parallelizing the processing for tables, especially when dealing with hundreds of tables.
  
- **Security:**  
  - Protect database credentials and ensure that only read-access is used for introspection.
  
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Implement robust logging at each stage (extraction, cleaning, LLM interaction) to facilitate debugging and future enhancements.

This step-by-step plan provides a comprehensive blueprint for automating the extraction, cleaning, and schema compression process for a Microsoft SQL Server database while handling token limits efficiently. Each step ensures that the LLM receives concise, context-rich inputs that adhere to token constraints, paving the way for an effective text-to-SQL system.
